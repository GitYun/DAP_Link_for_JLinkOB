VID:         Vendor ID
PID:         Product ID
Packet Size: USB packet size. Most probes use 64 byte HID packets. The Keil (non-bridge) firmware
             uses a 1024 byte packet. The NXP bridge and non-bridge CMSIS-DAP probes also use a
             1024 byte packet.
Has SWD:     Probe supports SWD protocol.
Has JTAG:    Probe supports JTAG protocol.
Has SWV:     Probe supports Serial Wire Viewer (NXP proprietary)
Has ETM:     Probe supports ETM (NXP proprietary)
Descriptor:  Text string (or partial text string) used to match against the probe product string.
             A non-null descriptor string is used for bridge probes to inform the server it must
             also match the debug connection on Usage Page or Interface number, depending on host.
             If used, both must be valid.
Usage Page:  Usage page, or 0 (zero) if don't care.
Interface:   Interface number, or -1 if don't care. See Descriptor.
